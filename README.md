1xBet live data save for FIFA eSport

<hr>

i created this script to gather data from FIFA eSport ( Live Games ) in 1xbet to see in what time they will score in game .

Example ( Responded in Database ) : ['20:01','52:00','90:00']

To Analyse this games to predict next games ! ( it works ;) )

i didn't used it for about 5 month so you maybe should edit some small things to work .

i wrote this script when i was 17 so i was not that much pro on javascript . it's mess hahaha :)))
