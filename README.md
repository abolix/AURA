## 📖 About
I originally created this script to **collect live data from FIFA eSport games (via 1xBet)** in order to analyze when goals were scored.  

**Example (saved in DB):**  
`['20:01', '52:00', '90:00']`


The idea was to analyze previous matches to help predict scoring patterns in upcoming games. (*And yes, it worked 😉*).  

This project is old (I wrote it when I was **17**) and I haven’t used it for about 5 months, so you may need to tweak a few things if you want to run it.  
Also, fair warning: the JavaScript is pretty messy 😂.
