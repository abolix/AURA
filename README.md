1xBet live data save for FIFA eSport

<hr>

i created this script to get live gather data from FIFA eSport in 1xbet to see in what time they will score in game .

example : ['20:01','52:00','90:00']

for predict next games . 

i did not used it for about 5 month so you maybe should edit some small things . hope it helps
